Right now I'm looking for any opportunity in the software developement field to apply my critical thinking skills to. In the mean time I decided to make this quick little site using Node and Express JS. Along with my experience and resume, I'll be adding some posts about myself, my likes, my hobbies, any current project I might be working on, and maybe try adding some fun games to play as well! Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, or even email me!",
